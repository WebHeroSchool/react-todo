### Hi! Nice to see you here.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This is my first React.js app and the final work in React module at Web Hero School.

You can see the result [here](https://whs-react-final.herokuapp.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Project description

The application contains two parts:

* To-do list 
* Page About, with information about me, including git-repositories of works and contacts for communication.

### How to work with the project:
- clone the repository (Use SSH or Use HTTPS)
- In the project directory, you can run: npm start react
- Open http: // localhost: 3000 to view it in the browser.
